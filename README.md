👋 Hi, I’m @elidatascience
👀 I’m interested in data science, data analytics for risk management, and anti-fraud.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, and R.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that explore creative solutions for analytical problems.
📫 How to reach me: My study email is eliabnerlunaestudos@gmail.com.
⚡ Fun fact: I’m pretty eclectic—I enjoy skateboarding, CrossFit, The Legend of Zelda, listen to a lot of João Gilberto, and my favorite food is Venezuelan arepas.
